# TODO

Validation depth
- Decide whether to enforce lint/test gates based on the design note and parity considerations.

Scoring
- Calibrate rubric weights and validate scoring on a small labeled set.

Robustness
- Add realistic drift scenarios (late Stripe invoices, missing stripe_customer_id mappings).
