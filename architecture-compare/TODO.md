# TODO

Validation depth
- Decide whether to upgrade syntax-only linting to typecheck/dbt compile (and keep parity across sandboxes).

Scoring
- Calibrate rubric weights and validate scoring on a small labeled set.

Robustness
- Add realistic drift scenarios (late Stripe invoices, missing stripe_customer_id mappings).
